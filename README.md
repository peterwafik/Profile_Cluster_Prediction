# Predictive_Clustering_UserProfiles

A cutting-edge project leveraging advanced clustering and machine learning techniques to enhance user profiling for cybersecurity. The study focuses on predicting user susceptibility to phishing based on email interactions and behavioral patterns. This repository includes code implementations, datasets, and results from extensive evaluations of clustering and predictive models.

## Key Features
- Dimensionality reduction with SOMs, GANs, and auto-encoders.
- Evaluation of clustering methods using metrics like Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Index.
- Predictive models for clustering validation, including SVMs, ANNs, and CNNs.

## Results
SOM-based clustering achieved the highest performance with robust interpretability, while SVM excelled in cluster prediction accuracy.
