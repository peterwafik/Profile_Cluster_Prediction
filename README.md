# Profile Cluster Prediction Machine Learning Model

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Profile Cluster Prediction machine learning model, developed as part of the research conducted in my Masterâ€™s thesis titled "AI-Powered Personalized Social Engineering: Merging Machine Learning with Trait-Driven Persuasion Tactics" at the German International University. The primary objective of this project is to categorize individuals into distinct psychological and behavioral clusters based on web-based influential features and predict the appropriate cluster for newly added individuals.

## Features

- **Clustering Algorithm**: Utilizes advanced clustering techniques to group individuals based on shared psychological and behavioral traits.
- **Predictive Model**: A machine learning model designed to predict the most likely cluster for new data points based on input features.
- **Personalized Insights**: Integrates psychological profiling with machine learning to provide tailored predictions and insights.
- **Scalable Design**: Capable of handling large datasets, making it suitable for practical applications in cybersecurity and beyond.
